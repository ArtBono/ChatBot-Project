# ChatBot-Project : Léon

We created a discord chatbot named "Léon", which is specialized in movies.

If you write a movie title, Léon will give you all the importants informations about it like the director, the main actors and even the IMDB rating.
We added several options : for instance if you write a genre on the chat (ex : action) Léon will find you a movie belonging to this genre. You can 
also find all the movies associated to a director, an actor or a year just by mentioning it in the chat.

We choosed to code Léon in python, and we uses JSON datafile format about movies, find on the internet.
